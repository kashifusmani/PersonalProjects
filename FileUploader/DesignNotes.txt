1. Overall Approach:

- Features Implemented/Use Cases:
Ability to Create a new account, login, login using Gmail, Add contacts.

- Database Schema Design:
The Use Cases warranted the state of Users and Contacts to be persisted in the database.
The website allows users to login from Gmail as well. This means that the registration state has 
to be maintained (If the user registered via our website or signed from Gmail). If user registered from our website, the application treats it as 
'internal' user, and 'openid' user otherwise.

- Service APIs: The following APIs are provided so that frontend/client side can easily query the required data
1. Add new account
2. Add/Edit a contact for a give user
3. Get contacts for a user
4. Login an 'internal' user
5. Login an 'openid' user. 

- Code Design:
1. Object Oriented Principles:
The code has been designed using Object Oriented Principles in mind. It uses Objects to manipulate data as opposed to passing around primitive datatypes.
Objects used are located under (com.addressbook.businessobjects and com.addressbook.servlets.beans)

2. MVC:
MVC approach is implemented by separating the View ( Javascript and Servlets), Controller (classes in com.addressbook.businesslogic) and
and Model ( classes in com.addressbook.dao).  

3. External Libraries
Wherever possible, existing standard libraries have been used to avoid reinventing the wheel. This includes the following
	- Jasypt : To encrypt and authenticate user supplied passwords
	- Hibernate: To avoid writing SQL statements by hand and avoid SQL Injections
	- JacksonMarshaler: To convert server response in json before sending to client
	- Log4J : To log information during code execution.

4. Testing
Backend Java codebase contains 25 classes out of which test cases have been written against 22 classes.
There is not much code in Javascript,  test cases have been written against ContactsManager.js
Overall, I am confident that there is greater than 85% line and branch coverage of the codebase.
Manual testing has been performed as well to make sure each function is working as expected.

- New technologies learnt I never used before:
1. Google Open Id Sign in
2. Include js
3. Qunit testing

Given more time I would have implemented the following features:

1. Responsive UI design for mobile/tablets.
2. Ability to delete contact
3. Edit Account details
4. More sign in providers
5. Persisting of nonce values to prevent replay attacks. 
6. Merge Gmail contacts for single sign-on users.
7. Forgot password

How much time it would have taken? I guess that depends on feature. But I would say 1 hour of work for each feature.

Given more time, I would have done the following to make the project more robust.
1. Set session timeout value after user logs in.
2. Add object model to frontend/javascript code
3. User input validation on backend. For example "email" is always in proper format (currently I check only if its not blank) 
4. All Servlets have two contructors. The no argument constructor is used by Tomcat/Production code. The argument one has been written to 
facilitate mock testing. In long run, this should be solved by using Spring Dependency Injection.
5. Due to time contraints, I was not able to write Integration tests.
6. Currently, there is some kind of dependency between Servlets and JSPs. For example, Login.java redirects to "home.jsp" on successful login.
It may not look as bad, but I feel that backend should not know anything about front end at all.
7. Add permissions model to tables in database.
